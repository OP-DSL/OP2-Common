This directory provides an implementation of the C and C++ OP2 interface.

To compile it, it is required to:

1. Set the environment variable CUDA_INSTALL_PATH to the appropriate path.
   For instance, on CX1 under bash, if we want to use cuda 4.0.11,
   we will have to set it as following:

      export CUDA_INSTALL_PATH=/apps/cuda/4.0.11

2. Set the environment variable OP2 to the base op2 directory,
   i.e. the one containing the "c" and "fortran" directories.
