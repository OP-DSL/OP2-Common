This directory provides an implementation of the C and C++ OP2 interface.

CMake build
===========

The recommended way of building the OP2 library and applications is using CMake
(http://cmake.org).

For a standard developer build with debugging symbols and all features enabled
run:

  ./cmake.local

This will configure and build the libraries in a build directory 'build' and
install headers and libraries with the current directory as installation prefix.

CMake will automatically detect which dependencies are installed and build the
libraries for which dependencies are satisfied, automatically skipping others.

Out-of-source builds
--------------------

CMake supports out-of-source builds and these are highly recommended. Using a
dedicated build tree has a number of advantages:

* The source remains free of object files and other 'clutter' from the build.
* Cleaning is as simple ad removing the build directory.
* It is possible to have many builds from the same source simultaneously with
  different build options.

How to run CMake
----------------

Other than running 'cmake.local' there are several options:

1.  Write your own build script based on cmake.local and customise it to your
    needs (recommended).

2.  Write a CMake script to populate the cache and pass it to CMake with

      cmake -C <cache-init-script>

3.  Use a cmake GUI (ccmake or cmake-gui) to set custom build options:

     mkdir build && cd build && ccmake ..

    will generate Makefiles in the subdirectory build.

4.  Call cmake directly, passing options on the command line with

      cmake -Dopt1=val1 -Dopt2=val2 ...

5.  Edit the cache file `build/CMakeCache.txt` with a text editor and re-run
    cmake (not recommended).

Customizing the build
---------------------

The configuration is controlled with CMake variables which are cached for
later invocations of CMake:

* Generic configuration options (defaults in parentheses):

  BUILD_SHARED_LIBS       -- Build shared OP2 libraries. (ON)
  USE_INSTALL_RPATH       -- Set rpath for installed shared libraries. (ON)
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX    -- Installation prefix (/usr/local)
  CMAKE_VERBOSE_CONFIGURE -- Enable verbose configuration output. (OFF)
  CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE  -- Create verbose makefiles (OFF)
                             (make VERBOSE=1 is still supported if OFF)

* Select which libraries variants to build (sequential, cuda, hdf5, mpi, openmp)

  This is controlled by the following CMake flags (enabled by default):

  OP2_WITH_SEQ      -- Build a sequential version of the OP2 library.
  OP2_WITH_OPENMP   -- Build an OpenMP version of the OP2 library.
  OP2_WITH_HDF5     -- Build an HDF5 version of the OP2 library.
  OP2_WITH_MPI      -- Build an MPI version of the OP2 library.
  OP2_WITH_PTSCOTCH -- Use PTScotch for partitioning in parallel.
  OP2_WITH_PARMETIS -- Use ParMETIS for partitioning in parallel.
  OP2_WITH_CUDA     -- Build a NVIDIA CUDA version of the OP2 library.

  Note that the dependencies given above are required for the respective
  libraries. If they cannot be found, the affected libraries are not built.

* Choose the build type and set compiler flags

  The following build types are available and come with pre-defined sets of
  compiler flags:

  Developer      -- Debug build with all warnings enabled
  Debug          -- Debug build with compiler optimizations disabled
  Release        -- Release build with compiler optimizations enabled
  RelWithDebInfo -- Release build with debugging symbols
  MinSizeRel     -- Release build optimized for minimum executable size

  Compiler flags for all build variants are controlled via the following
  variables:

  CMAKE_C_FLAGS   -- C compiler flags
  CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS -- C++ compiler flags
  CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS -- CUDA compiler flags

  With build type set to <VARIANT>, the following additional sets of compiler
  flags are active:

  CMAKE_C_FLAGS_<VARIANT>   -- Additional C compiler flags
  CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_<VARIANT> -- Additional C++ compiler flags
  CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_<VARIANT> -- Additional CUDA compiler flags

  Additional compiler definitions of the form -DFOO=BAR can be specified with
  the OP2_USER_DEFINITIONS variable.

* Set paths to non-standard installations of dependencies

  If CMake does not automatically detect installation paths of dependencies,
  or you want to override these, set custom paths as follows:

  * CUDA: set CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR if CUDA was not found and CUDA_BIN_PATH to
    override

  * HDF5: set HDF5_ROOT if HDF5 was not FOUND

  * MPI: CMake tries to extract the MPI library and include directories from
    the MPI compiler wrapper it finds in the path. If detection fails or you
    want to override what CMake found, set all of MPI_INCLUDE_PATH and
    MPI_LIBRARY (CMake 2.8.4 and earlier) / MPI_C_INCLUDE_PATH, MPI_C_LIBRARY,
    MPI_CXX_INCLUDE_PATH and MPI_CXX_LIBRARY (CMake 2.8.5 and newer) to
    disable auto detection.

  * ParMETIS: set PARMETIS_DIR if ParMETIS was not found. If you have a
    non-standard layout for your ParMETIS installation, i.e. the libraries are
    not in lib and headers in include, specify PARMETIS_LIB_DIR and/or
    PARMETIS_INCLUDE_DIR.

  * SCOTCH: set SCOTCH_DIR if PT-Scotch was not found. If you have a
    non-standard layout for your PT-Scotch installation, i.e. the libraries are
    not in lib and headers in include, specify SCOTCH_LIB_DIR and/or
    SCOTCH_INCLUDE_DIR.

Regular Makefile build
======================

To compile using the regular Makefiles provided, it is required to:

1. Set the environment variable CUDA_INSTALL_PATH to the appropriate path.
   For instance, on CX1 under bash, if we want to use cuda 4.0.11,
   we will have to set it as following:

      export CUDA_INSTALL_PATH=/apps/cuda/4.0.11

2. Set the environment variable OP2_COMPILER to either 'intel' or 'gnu' to
   select building with either icc or gcc compilers.

3. Set the environment variables MPI_INSTALL_PATH, PARMETIS_INSTALL_PATH and /
   or PTSCOTCH_INSTALL_PATH to the installation directories of these libraries.
   For instance:

      export PARMETIS_INSTALL_PATH=/home/gihan/ParMetis-3.1.1

      and / or

      export PTSCOTCH_INSTALL_PATH=/home/gihan/PT-Scotch
