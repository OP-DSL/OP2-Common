Developer Guide
===============

The developer guide is currently available in PDF form `here <https://op-dsl.github.io/docs/OP2/dev.pdf>`__, with an extension document detailing the MPI implementation `here <https://op-dsl.github.io/docs/OP2/mpi-dev.pdf>`__.

These documents are intended for anyone looking to develop OP2, or looking for a deeper insight into the operational details. If you just wish to use OP2 in your project then the :ref:`api:OP2 C/C++ API` should suffice.

.. warning::
   These documents have not been updated for a significant amount of time; beware that the information contained may be out-of-date.
