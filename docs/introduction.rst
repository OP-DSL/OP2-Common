Introduction
============

Overview
--------

`OP2 <https://github.com/OP-DSL/OP2-Common>`_ (Oxford Parallel library for Unstructured mesh solvers) is a high-level embedded domain specific language (eDSL) for writing **unstructured mesh** algorithms with automatic parellelisation on multi-core and many-core architectures. The API is embedded in both C/C++ and Fortran.

The current OP2 eDSL supports generating code targeting multi-core CPUs with SIMD vectorisation and OpenMP threading, many-core GPUs with CUDA or OpenMP offloading, and distributed memory cluster variants of these using MPI. There is also experimental support for targeting a wider range of GPUs using SYCL and AMD HIP.

These pages provide detailed documentation on using OP2, including an installation guide, an overview of the C++ API, a walkthrough of the development of an example application, and developer documentation.
