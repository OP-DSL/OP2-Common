OP2 is an API with associated libraries and preprocessors to generate
parallel executables for applications on unstructured grids.

This repository contains the implementation of the OP2 run-time
library and structured as follows:
|
`- op2: Implementation of the user and run-time OP2 C and Fortran APIs
|
`- apps: Application examples in C and Fortran
|  These are examples of target code an OP2 compiler should produce in
|  order to correctly use the OP2 run-time library. In addition, it
|  also contains the corresponding input files for sequential execution.
|
`- translator: Source-to-source translators for C and Fortran
|
`- doc: Documentation

This repository should not be confused with the OP2 compiler, which
can be found at: https://github.com/abetts155/OP2_ROSE_Fortran
