OP2 is an API with associated libraries and preprocessors to generate
parallel executables for applications on unstructured grids.

This repository contains the implementation of the run-time library
and the MATLAB prepreocessor, and is structured as follows:

|
`- op2: Implementation of the user and run-time OP2 C and Fortran APIs
|
`- apps: Application examples in C and Fortran
|
|  These are examples of user application code and also include
|  the target code an OP2 preprocessor should produce to correctly
|  use the OP2 run-time library.
|
`- translator: MATLAB OP2 preprocessor for C
|
`- doc: Documentation

This repository should not be confused with the ROSE OP2 preprocessor
which can be found at: https://github.com/OP2/OP2_ROSE_Fortran
