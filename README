This is the OP2 base directory providing:

1. An implementation of the user and run-time OP2 C and Fortran APIs ("op2" directory)

2. Application examples in C and Fortran ("apps" directory).
These are examples of what kind of code an OP2 compiler should produce in order to use correctly this
OP2 run-time library. In addition, it also contains the corresponding input files for sequential execution.

3. Translators for C and Fortran ("translator" directory)

4. Documentation ("doc" directory)

This repository should not be confused with the OP2 compiler, which can be found at:
